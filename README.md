# In this task
We use Python to integrate with a public API and visualize the retrieved data.

API Integration:
We use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data for selected cities. An API (Application
Programming Interface) allows communication between different software systems. After registering on
openweathermap.org, we get a personal API key that is required for authentication.

Data Collection:
The program sends HTTP requests using the 'requests' library to get weather data in JSON format. For each
city, we extract the current temperature (in Celsius) and humidity (in percentage).

Data Visualization:
To make the data easier to understand, we use the 'matplotlib' library to create bar charts. One bar chart
shows temperatures of the selected cities, and another shows humidity levels. These charts provide a quick
comparison of weather conditions.

Steps:
1. Install required libraries: requests, matplotlib.
2. Get a free API key from OpenWeatherMap.
3. Write a Python script to fetch and parse the data.
4. Use matplotlib to plot the data.

This project teaches practical skills in working with APIs, handling JSON data, and creating visualizations to
represent real-world information.
